```

### Rules

```
RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

In this virtual implementation, you and your friend can place a mark by selecting from the numbers 1 to 9 when prompted. This is illustrated below:

| (1) | (2) | (3) |
| (4) | (5) | (6) |
| (7) | (8) | (9) |
A winning position would like the image below at the end. As soon as someone gets three of their marks in a row, the game ends.
| O | X | O |
| X | X | X | --- Player 'X' wins with this row!
| O | O | O |
For a detailed explanation, please have a look at this guide.
